## Add a new font to the project ðŸ”¤

I wanted to add the FontAwesome regular star to the project, but the import failed.
Tried to write this: import { faStar as faRegularStar } from "@fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons";

But it failed. I had to add something to the package lock file. The following command was needed:

```bash
npm install --save @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons
```

After this was done, package lock got updated, and the import worked.
